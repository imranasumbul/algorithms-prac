I want to be a part of DESIS educare cohort because of my interest in the finTech industry. I have always been thrilled by how tech is used for high frequency tradings in the real world. To explore my interests further, I have been learning about Blockchain Technologies and integrating them with my web applications. 

As of now, I have gained experience in Web development technologies and won a hackathon for our team project named "Stree" in September 2024. "Stree" encompasses features that allow women to report unsafe incidents anonymously by dropping a pointer on an interactive map. The pointers accumulate around unsafe areas and inform tourists about them. I have also been a recipient of The Linux Foundation Scholarship in the past and am constantly learning about best Open source practices.

I am aware the number of women in Tech and Finance are among the least compared to other industries. This motivates me even more to challenge these norms and advocate for diversity in these fields. Pursuing a core major at an institute of national importance (IIIT Lucknow), I always try to build something innovative and impactful using my technical skills.  This cohort will give me a chance to be around like minded people, sharing my knowledge and helping each other out whenever needed. It will not only help me reach my goals, but also allow me to inspire younger girls who want to explore a career in FinTech.
